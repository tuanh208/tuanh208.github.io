*â€œI am a simple man, I love beautiful things, including my beloved wife, the nature and mathematics. "*

# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is NGUYEN Tu Anh (my pronouns are he/him/his). I am a PhD Candidate at the [ALMAnaCH team](http://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) (INRIA Paris) and [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) under the supervision of Prof. [Benoit Sagot](http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/) and Prof. [Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/) starting from 2021. I am also a visiting student at the [CoML team](https://cognitive-ml.fr/) (ENS Paris).

Before that, I graduated from the [master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) at [ENS Cachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay) (currently ENS Paris-Saclay). I was also a [*polytechnicien*](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) (engineering student at [Ã‰cole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique)).

I have interned at [La Javaness](https://www.lajavaness.com/), [SYSTRAN](https://www.systransoft.com/), [ENS Paris](https://cognitive-ml.fr/) and [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) (currently Meta AI).

My research interests include Speech Processing, Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning.

Personally, I like playing games, cooking and enjoying delicious food. I used to make some [noob music](https://soundcloud.com/tuanh208) for me as well as my wife. I am proud to be born in [Vietnam](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/vietnam-one-of-the-most-beautiful-countries-in-the-world-uk-magazine-3867727.html) <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/25/000000/vietnam.png"/>.

If you ever wonder what is the creature on the left. It's a *leo-pig* (I designed it ðŸ˜›), simply because I was born in [the Year of the Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac)), and my Zodiac Sign is [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)).
