*â€œI am a simple man, I love beautiful things, including my beloved wife, the nature and mathematics. "*

# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is NGUYEN Tu Anh (my pronouns are he/him/his). I am a PhD Candidate at the [ALMAnaCH team](http://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) (INRIA Paris) and [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) under the supervision of Prof. [Benoit Sagot](http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/) and Prof. [Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/). I am also a visiting student at the [CoML team](https://cognitive-ml.fr/) (ENS Paris).

Before that, I graduated from the [master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay), previously known as ENS Cachan. I was also a [*polytechnicien*](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) (engineering student at [Ã‰cole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique)).

I have interned at [La Javaness](https://www.lajavaness.com/), [SYSTRAN](https://www.systransoft.com/), [ENS](https://cognitive-ml.fr/) and [Facebook](https://ai.facebook.com/).

My research interests include Speech Processing, Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning.

If you ever wonder what is the creature on the left. It's a *leo-pig* (I designed it ðŸ˜›), simply because I was born in [the Year of the Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac)), and my Zodiac Sign is [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)).
